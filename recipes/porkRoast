    <h1>Gotcha! Roast Pork</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To respond to the threat of Mozuya, Sōma pioneered this dish to revive and represent the Sumiredōri Shopping District. Thanks to some high-quality chickens from Ikumi's family, as well as an original sauce made by Ikumi herself, this dish can be served quickly and is best eaten fresh. It is a light and portable meal, perfect for students and businessmen alike to eat on their way home!</p>
